Python: The Snake game is a classic arcade game that was first introduced in the late 1970s. The objective of the game is to control a snake that moves around a game board, eating food and growing longer with each bite. The game ends when the snake either collides with the walls or its own body.

1.The game board is a grid that is rectangular in shape. The snake begins at one end of the board and the food is randomly placed on the board.
2.The player controls the snake using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The snake moves in the direction of the arrow key pressed by the player.
3.The snake must navigate around the board to find and eat the food. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer.
5.As the snake grows longer, it becomes more difficult to navigate around the board without colliding with the walls or its own body. If the snake collides with either the walls or its own body, the game ends.
The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of pieces of food the snake eats. The longer the snake grows, the higher the score becomes.
